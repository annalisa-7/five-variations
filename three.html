    Will we work together?
    By Marge Piercy<br><br>
    <span style="opacity: 0.3">You wake in the early grey<br>
    morning in bed alone and curse<br>
    me, that I am only<br>
    sometimes there.</span><span style="opacity: 0.6"> But when<br>
    I am with you</span>, I <b>light</b><br>
    up the corners, I am bright<br>
    as a fireplace roaring<br>
    with love, every bone in my back<br>
    and my fingers is singing<br>
    like a tea kettle on the boil.<br>
    My heart wags me, a big dog<br>
    with a bigger tail. I am<br>
    a new coin printed with<br>
    your face. My body wears<br>
    sore before I can express<br>
    on yours the <small>smallest part</small><br>
    of what moves me. Words<br>
    shred and splinter.<br>
    I want to make with you<br>
    some bold new thing<br>
    to stand in the marketplace,<br>
    the statue of a goddess<br>
    laughing, armed and wearing<br>
    flowers and feathers. Like sheep<br>
    of whose hair is made<br>
    blankets and coats, I want<br>
    to force from this fierce sturdy<br>
    rampant love some useful thing.
